## Starter Files

The starterFiles directory refers to the files required to follow my <a href="https://youtu.be/h0dglh9elCw" target="_blank">video tutorial</a>.

## Finished Project

Includes the complete application, along with 2 jupyter notebooks with plenty of information to help you customize your own image classifying neural networks.

The complete app is also live and running on Taipy's cloud: https://classifier.taipy.cloud/

## Requirements
- The interface of the app was designed with Taipy GUI: https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy
- The neural network used in the app was designed with Tensorflow: https://github.com/tensorflow
- The user provided images were loaded with Pillow: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow
- And Numpy was used to normalize those images: https://github.com/numpy/numpy
